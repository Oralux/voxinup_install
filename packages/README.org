Helper scripts to build the voxinup debian packages.

Example: packages for Ubuntu 16.10

* build i386 packages under VM1 (Ubuntu 16.10 32 bits)
./release.sh

# the build.i386 directory contains all the i386 packages

* build amd64 packages under VM2 (Ubuntu 16.10 64 bits)
./release.sh

# the build.amd64 directory contains all the amd64 packages

* sign these packages
./sign.sh

# the signed packages are available in build.i386.sig and build.amd64.sig

* copy the packages to voxinup_install/build/debian
rm ../build/debian/*
cp build.{i386,amd64}.sig/*deb ../build/debian
