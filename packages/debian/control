Description: Connector between Voxin and Speakup or the Jupiter adapter
 voxinup is available in two modes:
 - a daemon that connects the speakup kernel modules to the Voxin
   software speech synthesizer through the /dev/softsynth device.
 - a process communicating through its standard input and outpout with
   the Jupiter adapter.
